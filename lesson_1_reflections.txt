How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	you used Dropbox, wiki, google docs, manual commits or git

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    clear and logical purpose. don't work too much without commitss

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because most time, a commit will refer to multiple file we restored them to a  repository in a project, these changes connects together

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    command line: git log  # hit into a project, show recent commits
				: git diff commitSHA1_hashcode_0 commitSHA1_hashcode_1  # show two commits diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

	I indeed more confident more
