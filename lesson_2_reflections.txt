What happens when you initalize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	git init  # in a empty floder or exsiting file floder run the code,
             # it will be create a series of file contains .git floder, zero commit.
	git log  # it display 'fatal: bad default revision ''HEAD''', this mean no commit, so.
    	git status  # initial commit and found untracked files
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	git add  # the operation let specific file or files to staging area
	git status  # check out tracked file in the staging area and untrack file in working				# directory
	I think staging area is just the cache area bettwen working directory and repository.
	staging area offers a single commit, this commit will contains less than one files
